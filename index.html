<p>OKC was expected to take another step forward after shattering expectations last season, but not like this.

  With almost half of the 2023-24 season in the books, the Thunder are in the running for the No. 1 seed in the Western Conference despite being the second-youngest team in the league. They have been elite on both ends of the court, ranking in the top 10 in both ends of the court, ranking in the top 10 in both offensive and defensive efficiency.
  
  The Thunder's success is driven by <b><i>Shai Gilgeous-Alexander</i></b> , who established himself as a star last season and is now looking like a legitimate MVP candidate. He can hurt teams in a variety of ways on offense, but he does his best work as the ball handler in pick-and-rolls. In addition to being a relentless driver and midrange assassin, there's one thing in particular the Thunder do that makes him so difficult to defend.You know what that means â€” to the film room!</p>

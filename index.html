<h2>This funky Shai Gilgeous-Alexander pick-and-roll explains why the Thunder's star is such a headache to defend</h2>

<p class="groove">OKC was expected to take another step forward after shattering expectations last season, but not like this.

  With almost half of the 2023-24 season in the books, the Thunder are in the running for the No. 1 seed in the Western Conference despite being the second-youngest team in the league. They have been elite on both ends of the court, ranking in the top 10 in both ends of the court, ranking in the top 10 in both offensive and defensive efficiency.
  
  The Thunder's success is driven by <b><i>Shai Gilgeous-Alexander</i></b> , who established himself as a star last season and is now looking like a legitimate MVP candidate. He can hurt teams in a variety of ways on offense, but he does his best work as the ball handler in pick-and-rolls. In addition to being a relentless driver and midrange assassin, there's one thing in particular the Thunder do that makes him so difficult to defend.You know what that means â€” to the film room!</p>

  <p class="groove">On the court for the Thunder are <i><b>Gilgeous-Alexander, Josh Giddey, Luguentz Dort, Jalen Williams and Chet Holmgren.</b></i> 

    Gilgeous-Alexander brings the ball up while Williams, a 6-5 forward, and Holmgren, a 7-1 center, space the floor by spotting up in opposite corners. Giddey, a 6-8 guard, makes his way to the dunker spot and Dort, a 6-3 guard, approaches Gilgeous-Alexander to set a screen.
    
    Dort doesn't actually make contact with Gilgeous-Alexander's defender. Instead, he slips the screen. Knowing how dangerous of a driver Gilgeous-Alexander is, Dort's defender, Julius Randle, is in a drop. The combination of Randle being in a drop and Josh Hart sticking with Gilgeous-Alexander prevent him from getting to the basket, but it comes at a cost: Dort is unguarded when he pops to the 3-point line.</p></p></p>
